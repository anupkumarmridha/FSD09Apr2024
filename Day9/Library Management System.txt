Library Management System

#### Objective:
Develop a console-based library management system to automate the process of borrowing and returning books by patrons.

#### Functional Requirements:

1. **Book Catalog:**
   - Maintain a catalog of available books, including details such as title, author, genre, publication date, and availability status.
   - Display the list of available books along with their details to patrons.

2. **Patron Management:**
   - Allow patrons to register by providing unique IDs, names, contact information, etc.
   - Provide the ability to search for patrons by name or ID.

3. **Book Borrowing:**
   - Patrons should be able to borrow available books from the library.
   - Each borrowing transaction should record the patron's ID, book ID, borrowing date, and due date.
   - Update the availability status of borrowed books accordingly.

4. **Book Returning:**
   - Patrons should be able to return borrowed books to the library.
   - Upon return, update the availability status of the book and calculate any applicable late fees.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **User Interface:**
   - Design an intuitive console interface with clear menus and prompts for easy book search, borrowing, and returning.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - The system should handle book transactions and inventory updates efficiently, even with a large number of books and patrons.

3. **Security:**
   - Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized library staff can perform administrative tasks such as book inventory management.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system to handle a growing number of books and patrons without performance degradation.

#### Optional Enhancements (Not required but could be added for further functionality):

1. **Reservation System:**
   - Allow patrons to reserve books that are currently checked out, ensuring availability upon their return.

2. **Membership Levels:**
   - Implement membership levels with different borrowing privileges or borrowing limits for patrons.

3. **Fine Payment Handling:**
   - Provide functionality for patrons to pay fines for overdue books, either in cash or through other specified methods.
